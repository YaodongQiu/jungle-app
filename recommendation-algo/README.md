This is a recommedation engine that has 4 main componenet.
Dataset file contain all data used for train and test.

Model file contain 2 machine learning model:
model1: Matrix Factorization model
model2: softmax model
Model file also contain different methods used to minimize score function: SVD/ WLS/ SGD

Engine is the main component call all other parts and assembled as a working recommedation system.

Test File contain methods used to compare the effetiveness of different model.
